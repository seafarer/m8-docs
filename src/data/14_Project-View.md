### About Project Files
Project files contain all song data including chains, phrases, instruments, as well as MIDI mappings and settings configurations. Samples are not stored in the project file. Moving or deleting samples will result in samples failing to load with the song.

### Bundles
Since samples are not stored inside the project file, you may want to share your work or archive a song. Bundling a song handles this. It creates a sub-folder in the “/Bundles” directory that contains the project file, samples, and instruments.
