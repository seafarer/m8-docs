# Instrument Pool View

The Instrument Pool view is an overview of all instrument slots in the current song. This view is accessible above the Instrument Modulation View (**[SHIFT]**+**[UP]**), as a shortcut from the Project View, and when selecting an instrument with **[EDIT]**+**[DOWN]** on instrument number “00” in phrase.

From this view it is possible to quickly adjust mixer related settings per instrument, load instruments or samples by tapping **[EDIT]** on an empty slot, copy/paste values or instruments **[SHIFT]**+**[OPT]**/**[SHIFT]**+**[EDIT]**, and reorder instruments with **[EDIT]**+**[UP or DOWN]** on the instrument name column.

Previewing an instrument is possible by pressing **[PLAY]** while playback is stopped. Navigating away from the Instrument Pool view to the right **[SHIFT]**+**[RIGHT]** navigates to the Instrument view for quickly jumping between the two views while managing instruments.
