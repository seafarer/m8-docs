# Mixer View

The mixer allows you to view and adjust the volume of each of the 8 tracks, the 3 send effects (ModFX, delay, and reverb), analog and USB input for monitoring; control the global DJ filter effect; and overall song EQ, volume, and limiter. The track’s volume in the mixer also adjusts its effect send levels.

All of the tracks, inputs, and effects are mixed together and routed through OTT, main EQ, limiter, DJ filter, and finally though the main song volume. Any clipping will appear as a red bar on the graphical meter.

* **Limiter (LIM)**: The main mix limiter which is engaged when its value is above 00.
* **DJ filter (DJF)**: Can be one of several mixed modes: low-pass / high-pass, low-pass / band-stop, and band-stop / high-pass. A value of “80” is off.
* **Over The Top (OTT)**: A multi-band upwards/downwards compression effect that is applied in parallel to the mix signal.
* **Dual-mono input mode**: Can be enabled by setting the “--” cell to the right of the input volume “00 --”.

With EQ is selected, **[SHIFT]**+**[RIGHT]** or **[EDIT]** will enter the EQ Editor View. With MIX or LIM selected, **[SHIFT]**+**[RIGHT]** or **[EDIT]** will enter the Limiter / Mix Scope View.
