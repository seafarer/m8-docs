# Instrument View

Use the instrument view to load, save, or edit the main settings for the sounds used in the song. There are 128 instruments available per song that each contain settings, instrument modulations, and a table. The M8 has 7 instrument types to choose from. Change the “TYPE” parameter to select one of the types currently available: Wavsynth, Macrosynth, Sampler, FM Synth, Hypersynth, MIDI Out, and External Instrument. The default type is set to “NONE” which helps both you and the M8 know when an instrument slot is being used. Use “LOAD” or “SAVE” to load or save an instrument preset from the SD card.

### General Instrument Settings
* **TYPE**: Set the instrument type as described above.
* **LOAD / SAVE**: Load or save an instrument preset to the SD card.
* **NAME**: Helps keep your song organized when browsing through instruments, saving an instrument, or exported when “bundling” your song.
* **TRANSP.**: Enable or disable all note transpositions from scales, chain transpose columns, or the project view transpose setting. This is useful for selectively disabling transposition on instruments that are used for percussive or effect elements.
* **TABLE TIC**: Set the default speed at which the instrument’s table increments through each step. The default is “01” or one tick per table step. “02” will be two ticks per step and so forth. There are a few special modes for incrementing the table position as discussed on the Table View. This setting can be overwritten by the TIC command effect in the phrase or table.
* **EQ**: Set the EQ slot number to assign an EQ to the current instrument. Press **[EDIT]** or navigate right **[SHIFT]**+**[RIGHT]** with the EQ highlighted to open the EQ Editor.
